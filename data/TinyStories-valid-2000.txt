Timmy was sad and tired of waiting to ride a motorcycle. Then, he met a girl named Lily. They became good friends and Timmy told her about his dream of riding a motorcycle. Lily said, "I know someone who can help you. He's my uncle and he has a motorcycle. Maybe he can teach you how to ride it."

Timmy was so happy and grateful to Lily. He went to meet her uncle and he taught him how to ride the motorcycle safely. Timmy was so excited that he said, "Lily, when I grow up, I'm going to marry you for being such a good friend and helping me achieve my dream." Lily smiled and said, "I'm happy to be your friend forever." The moral of the story is that true friendship can help you achieve your dreams.

The bird was hurt and couldn't fly anymore. It was very sad and missed flying high in the sky. From that day on, the bird stayed on the ground and never flew again.
Tom was a troubled boy. He did not like to eat his food. He only liked to eat candy and cake. His mom and dad were sad. They wanted Tom to be healthy and strong.

One day, mom made a soup for dinner. She put celery in the soup. She said, "Tom, this soup is good for you. It has celery. Celery is green and crunchy. It makes you grow and learn. Please try some."

Tom looked at the soup. He saw the celery. He did not want to eat it. He said, "No, mom. I do not like celery. It is yucky and bitter. I want candy and cake."

Mom sighed. She said, "Tom, you cannot have candy and cake every day. They are bad for you. They make you sick and tired. You need to eat your soup. It is warm and tasty. It has carrots and potatoes and chicken too. They are all good for you."

Tom shook his head. He said, "No, mom. I do not like soup. I do not like carrots and potatoes and chicken. I only like candy and cake."

Mom was sad. She said, "Tom, you are being stubborn and rude. You are hurting my feelings. You are not listening to me. You are not thanking God for your food. You need to pray and ask God to help you eat your soup."

Tom did not know what to do. He did not want to hurt mom's feelings. He did not want to be stubborn and rude. He did not want to make God angry. He wanted to be a good boy. He looked at the soup. He looked at mom. He looked at dad. He closed his eyes. He said, "God, please help me. I do not like soup. I do not like celery. But I love mom and dad. And I love you. Please make me eat my soup. Please make me like celery. Please make me healthy and strong. Amen."

Tom opened his eyes. He saw mom smiling. He saw dad nodding. He saw the soup steaming. He picked up his spoon. He took a sip. He was surprised. The soup was not yucky and bitter. It was warm and tasty. He took another sip. He liked it. He saw the celery. He bit it. It was green and crunchy. He liked it too. He ate his soup. He ate his celery. He was happy. He said, "Mom, dad, thank you for the soup. Thank you for the celery. They are good for me. I like them. And thank you, God, for helping me. I love you. Amen."
Anna and Ben are twins. They like to play with their toys and books. They also like to make jokes and tricks. One day, they find a big box in the living room. It has a bow and a tag. The tag says: "To Anna and Ben, from Santa".

Anna and Ben are very happy. They think Santa came early this year. They want to open the box and see what is inside. But they also want to wait for Christmas. They are confused. What should they do?

They decide to make a plan. They will open the box very carefully and see what is inside. Then they will wrap it again and put it back. They will act surprised on Christmas. They think this is a good joke.

They open the box and see a big teddy bear. It is soft and brown. It has a red scarf and a hat. Anna and Ben love it. They hug it and play with it. They forget about their plan. They forget about the time.

Mom and Dad come home. They see Anna and Ben with the teddy bear. They see the box and the paper. They are not happy. They are angry. They ask Anna and Ben what they did. Anna and Ben are scared. They try to lie. They say they found the teddy bear outside. They say they did not open the box.

Mom and Dad know the truth. They are not stupid. They tell Anna and Ben that they are naughty. They tell them that they broke the rule. They tell them that they have to say sorry. They tell them that they have to give back the teddy bear. They tell them that they have to wait for Christmas.

Anna and Ben are sad. They cry. They say sorry. They give back the teddy bear. They wrap it again and put it back. They learn their lesson. They do not make jokes and tricks with presents. They do not lie to Mom and Dad. They wait for Christmas. They hope Santa will forgive them.
Anna liked to examine things. She liked to look at them and touch them and ask questions. She wanted to know how they worked and why they were different. She examined her toys, her books, her clothes, and her pets.

One day, she decided to examine the bathtub. She climbed on a stool and looked inside. She saw water, soap, bubbles, and a rubber duck. She touched the water and felt it was warm. She touched the soap and felt it was slippery. She touched the bubbles and felt them pop. She touched the rubber duck and felt it squeak.

She thought the bathtub was attractive. It was shiny and white and had pretty patterns on the tiles. She liked the colors and the shapes. She liked how the water sparkled and the bubbles floated. She liked how the rubber duck smiled and the soap smelled.

She wanted to play in the bathtub. She took off her clothes and jumped in. She splashed and laughed and made more bubbles. She hugged the rubber duck and washed it with the soap. She had fun in the bathtub.

She did not hear her mom calling her. She did not see her mom coming in. She did not notice her mom's face. She only noticed her mom's voice when she said, "Anna, what are you doing? You are making a mess! You are supposed to examine things with your eyes, not with your whole body!"
Anna and Ben were friends who liked to play in the garden. They had a small plant that they watered every day. The plant had green leaves and purple flowers.

One day, Anna was feeling bossy. She wanted to water the plant by herself. She said to Ben, "Go away, this is my plant. You can't touch it."

Ben was sad and angry. He said, "No, it is our plant. We share it. You are not nice."

Anna and Ben started to fight. They pulled the plant from each other. The plant was hurt. Some of the leaves and flowers fell off.

Anna and Ben stopped fighting. They saw the plant and felt sorry. They said to the plant, "We are sorry, plant. We did not mean to hurt you. Please forgive us."

The plant did not say anything. But it still looked alive. Anna and Ben decided to be nice to each other and to the plant. They hugged and said, "We are friends. We share the plant. We are not bossy."

They watered the plant together and put it in a sunny spot. The plant was happy. It grew new leaves and flowers. Anna and Ben were happy too. They played in the garden and took care of the plant. They learned to forgive and share.
Tom and Mia were playing on the beach. They liked to find shells and make piles of them. Tom found a big shell that was shiny and had many colors. He was very happy and showed it to Mia.

"Look, Mia, I found a nice shell!" he said.

Mia looked at the shell and frowned. She recognized it. It was the same shell that she had found yesterday and left on her towel. She thought Tom had taken it from her.

"That is my shell, Tom!" she said. "You took it from me!"

Tom was confused and sad. He did not take the shell from Mia. He found it in the sand. He did not want to make Mia angry.

"No, Mia, I did not take your shell. I found it here. See, there are more shells like it." he said and pointed to the sand.

Mia did not believe him. She thought he was lying. She wanted her shell back. She tried to grab it from Tom's hand.

"Give me my shell, Tom! It is mine!" she said.

Tom did not want to give up his shell. He liked it too much. He held it tight and pulled it away from Mia.

"No, Mia, it is my shell! I found it first!" he said.

They both pulled and tugged on the shell. They were both angry and loud. They did not hear their mom calling them.

"Tom! Mia! Come here, please!" their mom said.

She saw them fighting over the shell. She was not happy. She walked over to them and took the shell from their hands.

"Stop it, both of you! What is going on?" she said.

Tom and Mia both tried to explain. They both said the shell was theirs. They both said the other one was wrong.

Their mom looked at the shell. She recognized it too. She had seen it before. She knew who it belonged to.

"Tom, Mia, this shell is not yours. It is not mine. It is not anyone's. It is a shell that belongs to the sea. It is a gift that the sea gives us to enjoy, but not to keep. Do you understand?" she said.

Tom and Mia looked at the shell. They looked at their mom. They looked at each other. They felt sorry for fighting. They nodded.

"Yes, mom, we understand." they said.

Their mom smiled and hugged them. She gave them the shell to hold together.

"Good. Now, why don't you share this nice shell and look for more shells to admire? But remember, when we leave the beach, we have to leave the shells behind. They are not ours to take. They are the sea's to give." she said.

Tom and Mia agreed. They thanked their mom and said sorry to each other. They held the shell and looked at its colors. They felt happy and peaceful. They went back to playing on the beach. They found more shells and made piles of them. They shared them and admired them. They did not fight over them. They had fun.
Ben and Mia were playing in the park with their bikes. They liked to ride fast and make noises. They saw a big hill and wanted to go down it.

"Let's race!" Ben said. "I bet I can go faster than you!"

"OK!" Mia said. "But be careful. There is a cable at the bottom of the hill. It is for the lights. We have to stop before we hit it."

They got ready and started to pedal. They went down the hill very fast. They felt the wind in their hair and the sun on their faces. They laughed and shouted.

But Ben did not listen to Mia. He wanted to win. He did not look at the cable. He did not stop. He hit the cable with his bike. He fell off and hurt his leg. He started to scream.

Mia stopped and ran to him. She saw the blood on his leg. She felt sorry for him. She said, "Ben, why did you not stop? I told you about the cable. You were not wise. You were silly. Now you are hurt."

Ben cried and said, "I'm sorry, Mia. I wanted to win. I did not think. You were wise. You were careful. Can you help me?"

Mia nodded and said, "Yes, I can help you. But first, we have to call Mom. She will know what to do. She will take you to the doctor. He will make your leg better."

She took out her phone and called Mom. She told her what happened. Mom said she would come right away. She told them to stay where they were and not to move.

Mia hugged Ben and said, "Don't worry, Ben. It will be OK. Mom is coming. She will help you. And I will stay with you. You are my brother. I love you."

Ben smiled and said, "Thank you, Mia. You are my sister. I love you too."
Tom was a cat who liked to play outside. He ran, jumped and chased birds and mice. He did not like to take baths or brush his fur. He thought he looked fine with his dirty, tangled coat.

One day, it was very cold and windy. Tom wanted to find a warm place to sleep. He saw a big house with a nice garden. He sneaked in through a hole in the fence. He saw a dog house with a soft blanket inside. He thought it was perfect for him.

He crawled into the dog house and curled up on the blanket. He felt cozy and happy. He did not know that the dog house belonged to Rex, a big, friendly dog who lived in the house.

Soon, Rex came back from his walk with his owner. He smelled a strange scent in his dog house. He barked and ran to see who was there. He saw Tom, the dirty cat, sleeping on his blanket. He was angry and scared.

"Who are you? Get out of my house!" Rex growled.

Tom woke up and saw Rex. He was terrified. He hissed and scratched Rex's nose. He tried to run away, but Rex blocked his way.

"Leave me alone! I just wanted to be warm!" Tom cried.

Rex and Tom fought and made a lot of noise. Their owner heard them and came to see what was wrong. He saw Rex and Tom, both hurt and scared. He picked up Tom and took him inside. He cleaned his wounds and gave him some food and water. He also gave him a bath and brushed his fur. He made him look clean and shiny.

He also checked on Rex and gave him a treat and a hug. He told him he was a good boy for protecting his house. He also told him he was sorry for the cat who was lost and cold.

He put Tom in a cage and called the animal shelter. He hoped they would find a good home for him. He felt sorry for him, but he knew he could not keep him. He already had Rex, who was his best friend.

Tom felt warm and full, but also sad and lonely. He wished he had a friend like Rex. He wished he had taken better care of himself. He realized he had been selfish and rude. He shivered in his cage and licked his paw. He hoped someone would love him and teach him how to be a good cat. He learned a hard lesson that day. He learned that being dirty and mean was not fun or smart. He learned that being clean and kind was better for him and others.
Anna and Ben were playing in the park. They liked to look at the sky and see the clouds. They saw many shapes in the clouds. They saw a bunny, a car, a flower and a star.

"Look, Ben, that cloud looks like a bunny!" Anna said, pointing at the sky.

"I see it, Anna, it has long ears and a fluffy tail!" Ben said, smiling.

They looked for more clouds that looked like things they knew. They recognized a car, a flower and a star. They were having fun.

Then they saw a big cloud that looked like nothing. It was just a big, white, fluffy cloud. It covered the sun and made the sky darker.

"What is that cloud, Anna?" Ben asked, feeling scared.

"I don't know, Ben, it is a strange cloud. Maybe it is a monster cloud!" Anna said, feeling scared too.

They hugged each other and wished the cloud would go away. They did not like the strange cloud.

But then the wind blew and the cloud moved. The sun came out again and made the sky bright and blue. The strange cloud was gone.

"Look, Ben, the sky is beautiful again!" Anna said, feeling happy.

"Yes, Anna, it is. And look, there is a rainbow!" Ben said, feeling happy too.

They saw the rainbow with many colors. They recognized red, orange, yellow, green, blue and purple. They liked the rainbow. It was a beautiful cloud. They smiled and clapped their hands. They were not scared anymore. They were happy.
Lily and Ben were playing in the garden. They liked to observe the bugs and the flowers. They saw a big mushroom under a tree. It was brown and round and had spots on it.

"Look, a mushroom!" Lily said. "Can we touch it?"

"I don't know," Ben said. "Maybe it is not good to touch. Mom said some mushrooms are bad."

Lily wanted to touch it anyway. She reached out her hand and poked the mushroom. It felt soft and wet. But then the mushroom broke and fell apart. Lily gasped.

"Oh no!" Ben said. "You broke the mushroom! What if it was someone's home? What if a bug lived there?"

Lily felt sorry. She did not mean to break the mushroom. She did not know it was so fragile. She looked at the pieces of the mushroom on the ground. She saw a small worm crawling out of one of them. She felt even more sorry.

"I'm sorry, worm," she said. "I'm sorry, mushroom. I did not want to hurt you. I was just curious."

Ben saw that Lily was sorry. He hugged her and said, "It's okay, Lily. You did not know. Maybe we can find another mushroom for the worm. Maybe we can help it find a new home."

Lily nodded. She wiped her tears and smiled. She and Ben looked around the garden for another mushroom. They found one that was smaller and white and had no spots. They carefully picked it up and brought it to the worm. They placed it near the broken mushroom and hoped the worm would like it.

"Here you go, worm," Lily said. "This is a new mushroom for you. We hope you are happy. We are sorry for breaking your old mushroom."

The worm wiggled and seemed to say thank you. Lily and Ben felt happy. They learned to be more careful with the things they observe. They also learned to say sorry when they make a mistake. They went back to playing in the garden, but they did not touch any more mushrooms. They just looked at them and admired their colors and shapes.
Lily and Ben liked to play pirates in the garden. They had a big box that was their ship, and a stick that was their sword. They also had a hook that they found in the shed. It was shiny and sharp, and they pretended it was a treasure.

One day, they decided to go on an adventure to find more treasure. They put on their hats and scarves, and took their ship, sword and hook with them. They walked around the garden, looking for clues. They saw a bird, a flower, a rock, but no treasure.

Then, they saw something shiny under a bush. They ran towards it, hoping it was gold or jewels. But when they got closer, they saw it was a frozen pond. It was very cold and slippery, and they could see fish and plants under the ice.

"Wow, look at that!" Lily said. "Maybe there is treasure under the ice!"

"Let's find out!" Ben said. He took the hook and tried to break the ice with it. He hit the ice hard, but it did not crack. He hit it again, and again, but nothing happened.

"Be careful, Ben!" Lily said. "You might fall in!"

Ben did not listen. He wanted to find the treasure. He hit the ice harder and harder, until he made a small hole. He looked inside, and saw something shiny. He reached for it with his hook, but he lost his balance. He slipped and fell into the pond.

Lily screamed. She saw Ben go under the water. She was very scared. She did not know what to do. She wanted to help Ben, but she did not want to fall in too. She looked around, and saw a big stick. She grabbed it, and ran to the pond. She lay down on the ice, and reached for Ben with the stick.

"Ben, Ben, grab the stick!" she shouted. "I'll pull you out!"

Ben heard Lily's voice. He was very cold and wet. He saw the stick, and grabbed it. Lily pulled him out of the pond. He was shivering and coughing. He dropped the hook, and hugged Lily.

"Thank you, Lily!" he said. "You saved me!"

"I'm sorry, Ben!" Lily said. "I should have been more polite. I should have let you have the hook. It was your treasure."

Ben shook his head. He smiled at Lily. He said, "No, Lily, you are my treasure. The hook was just a hook. It was not worth it. You are my best friend."

They hugged each other, and walked back to their ship. They decided to play pirates another day, when it was warmer and safer. They learned their lesson. They learned to be careful, and to share, and to be polite. They were happy.
Lily and Ben went to the park with Mom. They saw a big pond with many ducks and swans. Lily liked the swans. They were white and graceful. She wanted to feed them some bread.

"Mom, can I give some bread to the swans?" Lily asked.

"Sure, but be careful. Don't go too close to the water. And don't throw the bread too hard. The swans might get scared," Mom said.

Lily nodded and took a piece of bread from Mom. She walked slowly to the edge of the pond. She saw a swan swimming near her. She smiled and tossed the bread gently to the swan. The swan caught the bread and ate it. It looked happy.

"Thank you, swan!" Lily said.

The swan nodded and swam away. Lily looked for another swan to feed. She saw one that was hidden behind some reeds. It was smaller than the other swans. It looked shy.

"Hello, swan! Do you want some bread?" Lily called.

The hidden swan peeked out from the reeds. It saw Lily and the bread. It wanted the bread, but it was afraid of Lily. It stayed behind the reeds.

"Come on, swan! Don't be scared. I won't hurt you. I just want to be your friend," Lily said.

She threw the bread closer to the hidden swan. The hidden swan saw the bread. It was hungry. It decided to try the bread. It swam out from the reeds and took the bread. It tasted good.

"Thank you, Lily!" The hidden swan said.

Lily was surprised. She didn't know that swans could talk.

"You're welcome, swan! What's your name?" Lily asked.

"My name is End. I'm the last of my family. The other swans left me because I'm different. I can talk, but they can't," End said.

"That's sad, End. But you're not alone. You have me. I'm your friend. And you're not different. You're special," Lily said.

End smiled. He felt happy. He had a friend.

"Thank you, Lily. You're special too. Can I stay with you?" End asked.

"Of course, End. You can stay with me. Come on, let's go to Mom. She'll like you too," Lily said.

She took End's wing and led him to Mom. Ben saw them and was amazed.

"Wow, Lily! You have a talking swan!" Ben said.

"Yes, Ben. This is End. He's my friend. Can he play with us?" Lily said.

"Sure, Lily. He can play with us. Hi, End. I'm Ben. Nice to meet you," Ben said.

"Hi, Ben. Nice to meet you too. You're Lily's brother, right?" End said.

"Yes, I am. You're very smart, End," Ben said.

"Thank you, Ben. You're very kind, Ben," End said.

Mom saw them and was shocked.

"Lily, Ben, what's going on? Who's this swan?" Mom asked.

"Mom, this is End. He's a talking swan. He's my friend. Can he stay with us?" Lily said.

"A talking swan? That's incredible. How did you find him?" Mom asked.

"He was hidden behind some reeds. He was lonely. I gave him some bread. He thanked me. He told me his name. He asked me to be his friend. I said yes. He's very nice, Mom. Please, can he stay with us?" Lily said.

Mom looked at End. He looked at Mom. He nodded.

"Hello, Mom. I'm End. I'm a talking swan. I'm Lily's friend. Can I stay with you?" End said.

Mom was speechless. She didn't know what to say. She looked at Lily and Ben. They looked at Mom. They smiled.

"Please, Mom. Please," they said.

Mom sighed. She smiled too.

"Okay, okay. You can stay with us, End. But only if you promise to be good and not make too much noise. And you have to share the bread with the other swans. Deal?" Mom said.

"Deal, Mom. Thank you, Mom. You're very nice, Mom," End said.

Lily, Ben, and End hugged Mom. They were happy. They had a new friend. A talking swan. His name was End. But his story was just beginning.
